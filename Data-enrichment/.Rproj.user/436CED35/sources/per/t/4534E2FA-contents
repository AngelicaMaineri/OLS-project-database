Hello! Thank you for your interest in my project.

[Open Life Science - OLS](https://openlifesci.org/) is a mentorship programme to learn more about Open Science and Open Leadership, and mentees carry out individual or group projects. With over 200 projects, the list is now very rich yet also difficult to navigate. The aim of my project is to build a searchable database of OLS projects, for future, current and past OLS participants.

Thanks to my database, it will be possible to browse all projects from one page, filter them based on keywords and/or project members, and track the projects progress and outputs.

You can see a protype of the database below!

Contribution guidelines will follow soon. In the meantime, if you have ideas or comments, please open an issue or reach out to Angelica Maineri

_This project is carried out in the framework of OLS-7_

## Notes
The tagging of the domain is currently just a first attempt based on some keywords. SSH stands for Social Sciences and Humanities, LSH for Life Sciences and Health and NES for Natural and Engineering Sciences.

## Prototype

```{r loaddata}
df = read_csv("./Data-enrichment/Data/projects_domain_people.csv")
DT::datatable(df, escape = FALSE,
              filter = "top", 
              options = list(dom = "ft", 
                            pageLength = 1000),
              rownames = FALSE)
```
